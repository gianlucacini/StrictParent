# Unplug
Unplug is an internet blocker for windows computers.

## This app might help you if:
- You are struggling with any internet related addictions (online gaming, gambling, pornography, video streaming)
- You waste hours of time a day mindlessly sufring the web instead of doing something more productive
- You work too much and you'd like to reach a healthy work/life balance
- Or you simply would like to gain more control over your internet use

## Features
- Blocks internet and every other outbound connection for a custom timespan (e.g. from 8AM to 5PM or from 10PM to 8AM)
- "Lock" your settings for 1 or more days
- Hard to bypass, but only if you want

## How to Install

and download the installer. After the installation double click on the newly created icon "Unplug Settings"

## Thoughts / Advice (may not be applicable to you)

Realize that internet addiction/abuse may not be the cause of your problems, but the symptom.

Just like alcoholism or binge eating, it is a coping mechanism that "helps" you deal with stress, anger, loneliness, anxiety or depression.

Understand that, although an app like this can be helpful, it will not solve the underlying problem. 

## How to overcome an addiction

seek professional help, cognitive-behavioral therapy, counseling, support groups, exercise and clean eating, meditation, spend more time outdoors and less time indoors, sit less and move more, work less and relax more, spend less time by yourself and more time socializing.  

## My phone and pc setup to minimize screen time

if you have a desktop computer, after you are done using it, unplug the power supply chord and put it in something like a kitchen safe (check it out on amazon)

if you have a laptop, you can put it in a laptop bag, lock it with a small padlock and store the key in the kitchen safe (this is not a kitchen safe ad ðŸ˜…)

I have a laptop and what i do is i simply leave it at my office during the week days, and then use the above method on the week-end.

With regards to your phone, it is a little bit difficult since most people spend all their waking hours on it.

I personally have an android phone with LineageOS installed. The cool thing about it is that you can remove the browser and the app store while still being able to install useful apps like google maps and instant messaging apps like whatsapp or telegram. Removing the app store means that you will not be tempted to download games or video streaming apps. [TBC]

some smartphones like huawei and honor have a "digital balance" feature that limits your phone and app usage which could be an interesting option.
